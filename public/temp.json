      "description": "Say hello to Ruby! Miss Ruby is a one and a half year old Staffordshire terrier. This precious girl was found by her foster mom sadly abandoned in a crate on the side of the road. She\n\nis a sweet and\n\nloving dog despite her ruff past. Her favorite activities include cuddling on the couch\n\n, eating, and going for walks. Ruby is housetrained and working on basic commands\n\nlike sit and down. She is crate-trained and doesn\u0027t mind lounging there in her comfy bed while you\u0027re away.\n\nAlthough she\u0027s over a year old, Ruby\n\nstill has plenty of p\n\nuppy energy and typically g\n\nreets people with the same, enthusiastic, puppy joy\n\nand may try to wiggle into laps and lick faces. She is eager to please, quick to respond to corrections, and will be easy to train.\n\nRuby is adjusting well to home life after being abandoned and spending some time at the shelter. She loves all people and meeting new people is fun and exciting. She\u0027s a curious dog and loves to explore, but at the same time can be timid in new situations and easily startled. With training and socialization in her new home, Ruby\u0027s confidence and spirit will continue to blossom.\n\n1 1/2 years old\n\nhouse trained\n\ncrate trained\n\ngood with big and small humans (babies unknown)\n\ngood with dogs of all sizes\n\nheartworm negative\n\nthe BEST ears and tiny jowlies\n\nloves belly rubs and ear rubs\n\nNO cats or small animals\n\nPlease contact us at PacoCorpRescue@gmail.com to set up a meet and greet with Ruby! 1/31/22 1:08 PM",
